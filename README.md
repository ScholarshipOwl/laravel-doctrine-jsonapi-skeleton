# Laravel Doctrine JSON:API Skeleton

This skeleton provides a template for building API-only Laravel applications using Doctrine ORM and the [laravel-doctrine-jsonapi](https://github.com/ScholarshipOwl/laravel-doctrine-jsonapi) package for fully compliant [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) implementations.

**Key Features:**
- **Doctrine ORM**: Replaces Eloquent as the database layer, leveraging Doctrine's advanced data-mapping capabilities via [laravel-doctrine/orm](https://github.com/laravel-doctrine/orm).
- **Doctrine Migrations**: Database migrations using [laravel-doctrine/migrations](https://github.com/laravel-doctrine/migrations).
- **Doctrine Extensions**: Extra features (sluggable, timestamps, soft deletes, etc.) via [laravel-doctrine/extensions](https://github.com/laravel-doctrine/extensions).
- **JSON:API**: All APIs conform to the JSON:API specification for standardized, robust, and scalable APIs.
- **API-Only**: No web routes or traditional Blade views are exposedâ€”this skeleton is focused exclusively on backend API development.
- **Automatic API Documentation**: Generates OpenAPI specs, Postman collections, and human-friendly docs using [Scribe](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/).

## About This Skeleton
This project is intended as a starting point for developers who want to:
- Use Laravel as the application framework
- Use Doctrine ORM for data persistence (with full support for migrations and extensions)
- Expose only JSON:API-compliant endpoints (no web UI)

You get a clean Laravel installation, ready for Doctrine and JSON:API integration.

## Quick Start

You can start a new project using this skeleton by running:

```bash
composer create-project sowl/laravel-doctrine-jsonapi-skeleton jsonapi
```

  - [X] Set up migration paths
- [X] Install and configure Doctrine Extensions ([laravel-doctrine/extensions](https://github.com/laravel-doctrine/extensions))
  - [X] Install Gedmo extensions requirement
  - [X] Enable useful extensions (timestamps, sluggable, soft deletes, etc.)
- [X] Set up basic `User` entity
  - [X] Set up entity folder structure
  - [X] Setup authentication and all the relevant user traits
  - [X] Add migration of the `User` entity and rest default entities.
  - [X] Tests for authentication logic

- [X] Create a transformer extending `AbstractTransformer`
- [X] Set up API routes (remove `web.php`, use `api.php` only)
- [X] Add example resource controller (using default or custom controller)
- [X] Add policy-based authorization for resources
- [X] Add validation for JSON:API requests
- [X] Implement authentication (e.g., Laravel Passport, Sanctum, or JWT)
- [X] Integrate [Scribe](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/) for automatic generation of OpenAPI specs and API docs
  - [X] Configure Scribe for API-only docs
  - [X] Ensure docs include OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, and sample responses
  - [X] Add custom docs for example resource
- [X] Configure proper exception handling with showing JSON:API errors.
- [ ] Use GUID for the primary key of the entities.

  - [ ] Assign roles to users and restrict resource actions accordingly
  - [ ] Add policies and middleware for RBAC enforcement
  - [ ] Document RBAC usage and configuration
