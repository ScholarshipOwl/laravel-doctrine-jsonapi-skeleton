# Scribe Blade Files

By default Scribe type "external_laravel" builds file `index.blade.php` on each generation.

But we want to make some overriedes to it, improve it keeping same behavior of other files generation.

So the `index.blade.php` file can be ignored after the generation and `scribe.blade.php` file will be used.
